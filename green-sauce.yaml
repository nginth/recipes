ingredients:
  - 6 large fresh Jalapeño chiles
  - 0.25 of a large yellow onion
  - 2 large garlic cloves
  - 0.5 to 0.75 of a cup corn oil, grapeseed oil, sunflower oil or extra virgin olive oil, or a combination of two.
  - 1 teaspoon kosher salt
directions:                 
  - In a small pot bring water to a boil, enough water to cover the chiles and piece of onion. 
  - Simmer the jalapenos and onions for about 15-20 minutes until they change in color and are fork tender, but not mushy. 
  - Remove stems after they cool down a bit and strain some of the excess water.                        
  - Using an immersion blender, a food processor or a regular blender, combine the oil, garlic cloves, strained jalapeños onions and salt.                        
  - Blend until it looks frothy, creamy and pale green.                        
  - Taste for salt, adjust if necessary. Transfer to a squeeze bottle, and refrigerate. It will last for about a week.
